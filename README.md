# C - Simple Shell

Group Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX Program**.This is a project about creating our own printf for the Holberton School curriculum. My partner was Samson Onwonga

## Technologies

* Editors used: vi, vim
* All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

## Resources

* <a href= "https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/64">Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell</a>
* <a href= "https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/350">Approaching a Project</a>
* <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell">Unix shell</a>
* <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_shell">Thompson shell</a>
* <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

* Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
* Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
* Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
* Who is Ken Thompson
* How does a shell work
* What is a pid and a ppid
* How to manipulate the environment of the current process
* What is the difference between a function and a system call
* How to create processes
* What are the three prototypes of main
* How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
* How to execute another program with the execve system call
* How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children     terminates
* What is EOF / “end-of-file”?

## Files
The following files are available for this project:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `Task 0` | Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks|
| `Task 1` | Write a UNIX command line interpreter.|
| `Task 2` |Handle command lines with arguments |
| `Task 3` |Handle the PATH, fork must not be called if the command doesn’t exist |
| `Task 4` |Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell |
| `Task 5` |Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment |




## Conclusion

In conclusion, the C-Simple Shell project completed during the Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX Program, in collaboration with Samson Onwonga, was a great opportunity to learn about the Unix shell, processes, and system calls. The project provided an understanding of the design and implementation of the original Unix operating system, the first version of the UNIX shell, and the B programming language. It also taught how to manipulate the environment of the current process, create processes, and execute other programs with the execve system call. Completing the tasks, including handling command lines with arguments, implementing built-in functions like exit and env, was an excellent way to improve programming skills and become proficient with technologies like vi, vim, and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS..
